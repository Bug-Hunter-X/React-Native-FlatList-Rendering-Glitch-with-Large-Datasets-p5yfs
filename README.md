# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using `FlatList` in React Native with large datasets and frequent updates. The issue results in missing items or blank spaces appearing in the list. This example includes a reproduction of the problem and a solution to fix it. 

## Problem
The `FlatList` component struggles to efficiently handle rapid data changes and updates, especially with large datasets.  Incorrect implementation of the `keyExtractor` function or unnecessary re-renders can exacerbate the problem.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully managing data updates, optimizing the `keyExtractor`, and implementing techniques to reduce the number of re-renders.  Using `useMemo` to memoize calculations can improve performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
